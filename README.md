![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7250e722-3f7e-49f2-9439-9b8ad75a1981)

**Meshtastic-AI** (MESH-AI for short) is an experimental project that bridges [Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org/) LoRa mesh networks with powerful AI chatbots. This release builds on the previous Alpha v0.3.0 version by introducing a major WebUI overhaul, enhanced error handling with UTC‑based logging, refined command processing (including case‑insensitivity), and expanded integrations for emergency notifications via Twilio, SMTP email, and Discord. You can choose between local models (LM Studio, Ollama), OpenAI, or even integrate with Home Assistant for off‑grid AI assistance.

> **Disclaimer:**  
> This project is **NOT ASSOCIATED** with the official Meshtastic Project. It is provided solely as an extension to add AI and advanced features to your Meshtastic network.  
>  
> **Alpha Software Warning:**  
> This version is still in alpha. It may be unstable or incomplete. Please avoid relying on it for mission‑critical tasks or emergencies. Always have backup communication methods available and use responsibly.

## Features

- **Multiple AI Providers**  
  - Support for **Local** models (LM Studio, Ollama), **OpenAI**, and even **Home Assistant** integration.
- **Home Assistant Integration**  
  - Seamlessly forward messages from a designated channel to Home Assistant’s conversation API. Optionally secure the integration using a PIN.
- **Advanced Slash Commands**  
  - Built‑in commands: `/about`, `/ping`, `/test`, `/help`, `/motd`, `/ai` (aliases: `/bot`, `/query`, `/data`), `/emergency` (or `/911`), `/whereami` plus custom commands via `commands_config.json`.
  - Commands are now case‑insensitive for improved mobile usability.
- **Emergency Alerts**  
  - Trigger alerts that are sent via **Twilio SMS**, **SMTP Email**, and, if enabled, **Discord**.
  - Emergency notifications include GPS coordinates, UTC timestamps, and user messages.
- **Enhanced REST API & WebUI Dashboard**  
  - A modern three‑column layout showing broadcast messages, direct messages, and available nodes.
  - Additional endpoints include `/messages`, `/nodes`, `/connection_status`, `/logs`, `/send`, `/ui_send`, and a new `/discord_webhook` for inbound Discord messages.
  - UI customization through settings such as theme color, hue rotation, and custom sounds.
- **Improved Message Chunking & Routing**  
  - Automatically splits long AI responses into configurable chunks with delays to reduce radio congestion.
  - Configurable flags control whether the bot replies to broadcast channels and/or direct messages.
- **Robust Error Handling & Logging**  
  - Uses UTC‑based timestamps with an auto‑truncating script log file (keeping the last 100 lines if the file grows beyond 100 MB).
  - Enhanced error detection (including specific OSError codes) and graceful reconnection using threaded exception hooks.
- **Discord Integration Enhancements**  
  - Route messages to and from Discord.
  - New configuration options and a dedicated `/discord_webhook` endpoint allow for inbound Discord message processing.
- **Windows‑Focused with Planned Linux/macOS Support**  
  - Official support for Windows environments with installation guides; instructions for Linux/macOS are coming soon.

## Changelog

## 1. Changelog: v0.1 → v0.2.2

- **Expanded Configuration & JSON Files**  
   - **New `config.json` fields**  
     - Added `debug` toggle for verbose debugging.  
     - Added options for multiple AI providers (`lmstudio`, `openai`, `ollama`), including timeouts and endpoints.  
     - Introduced **Home Assistant** integration toggles (`home_assistant_enabled`, `home_assistant_channel_index`, secure pin, etc.).  
     - Implemented **Twilio** and **SMTP** settings for emergency alerts (including phone number, email, and credentials).  
     - Added **Discord** webhook configuration toggles (e.g., `enable_discord`, `discord_send_emergency`, etc.).  
     - Several new user-configurable parameters to control message chunking (`chunk_size`, `max_ai_chunks`, and `chunk_delay`) to reduce radio congestion.  
- **Support for Multiple AI Providers**  
   - **Local Language Models** (LM Studio, Ollama) and **OpenAI** (GPT-3.5, etc.) can be selected via `ai_provider`.  
   - Behavior is routed depending on which provider you specify in `config.json`.
- **Home Assistant Integration**  
   - Option to route messages on a dedicated channel directly to Home Assistant’s conversation API.  
   - **Security PIN** requirement can be enabled, preventing unauthorized control of Home Assistant.  
- **Improved Command Handling**  
   - Replaced single-purpose code with a new, flexible **commands system** loaded from `commands_config.json`.  
   - Users can define custom commands that either have direct string responses or prompt an AI.

   - `/emergency` (or `/911`) triggers optional Twilio SMS, SMTP email, and/or Discord alerts.  
   - Retrieves node GPS coordinates (if available) to include location in alerts.  
- **Improved Message Chunking & Throttling**  
   - Long AI responses are split into multiple smaller segments (configurable via `chunk_size` & `max_ai_chunks`).  
   - Delays (`chunk_delay`) between chunks to avoid flooding the mesh network.  
- **REST API Endpoints** (via built-in Flask server)  
   - `GET /messages`: Returns the last 100 messages in JSON.  
   - `GET /dashboard`: Displays a simple HTML dashboard showing the recently received messages.  
   - `POST /send`: Manually send messages to nodes (direct or broadcast) from external scripts or tools.  
- **Improved Logging and File Structure**  
   - **`messages.log`** for persistent logging of all incoming messages, commands, and emergencies.  
   - Distinct JSON config files: `config.json`, `commands_config.json`, and `motd.json`.  
- **Refined Startup & Script Structure**  
   - A new `Run Mesh-AI - Windows.bat` script for straightforward Windows startup.  
   - Added disclaimers for alpha usage throughout the code.  
   - Streamlined reconnection and exception handling logic with more robust error-handling.  
- **General Stability & Code Quality Enhancements**  
   - Thorough refactoring of the code to be more modular and maintainable.  
   - Better debugging hooks, improved concurrency handling, and safer resource cleanup.

## Basic Usage

- **Interacting with the AI:**  
  - Use `/ai` (or `/bot`, `/query`, `/data`) followed by your message to receive an AI response.
  - For direct messages, simply DM the AI node if configured to reply.
- **Location Query:**  
  - Send `/whereami` to retrieve the node’s GPS coordinates (if available).
- **Emergency Alerts:**  
  - Trigger an emergency using `/emergency <message>` or `/911 <message>`.  
    - These commands send alerts via Twilio, SMTP, and Discord (if enabled), including GPS data and timestamps.
- **Sending and receiving SMS:**  
  - Send SMS using `/sms <+15555555555> <message>`
  - Config options to either route incoming Twilio SMS messages to a specific node, or a channel index.
- **Home Assistant Integration:**  
  - When enabled, messages sent on the designated Home Assistant channel (as defined by `"home_assistant_channel_index"`) are forwarded to Home Assistant’s conversation API.
  - In secure mode, include the PIN in your message (format: `PIN=XXXX your message`).
- **WebUI Messaging:**  
  - Use the dashboard’s send‑message form to send broadcast or direct messages. The mode toggle and node selection simplify quick replies.
